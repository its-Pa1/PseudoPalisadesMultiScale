# TWA Directory

## Main Files/Scripts

- **TWA_i.m** (i = II, III): The main MATLAB script which calls all the functions (scripts) and computes the eigenvalues of J2, J3 (eq. 2.B.7 and 2.B.9) corresponding to a positive wave speed (c) as mentioned in Appendix 2.B of the thesis ("Diss_Kumar_Pawan.pdf" present in the parent directory).

- **TWA_J3_II.m**: Computes the eigenvalues of the Jacobian J3 (eq. 2.B.9) for a given c.

## Functions

- **function_g.m**: Computes the nondimensionalised g(S(x)) involved in eq. 2.5.2.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB**: 2018a or later version (it should work for older versions as well).
