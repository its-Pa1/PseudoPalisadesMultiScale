Main files/scripts:
The file "TWA_i.m" (i = II,III) is the main matlab script which calls all the functions (scripts) and computes the eigenvalues of J2, J3 (eq. 2.B.7 and 2.B.9) corresponding to a positive wave speed(c) as mentioned in Appendix 2.B of the thesis ("Diss_Kumar_Pawan.pdf" present in the parent directory).

TWA_J3_II: computes the eigenvalues of the Jacobian J3 (eq. 2.B.9) for a given c.


Functions:
function_g.m: computes the nondimensionalised g(S(x)) involved in eq. 2.5.2.



Requirement: Matlab(2018a or later version, it should work for older version also)
